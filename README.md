# PHP Symfony Env

Since my beginnings as a Back End engineer (around 2016), PHP was my first opportunity to get into this branch of programming.

This project is a bit about the skills and packages that I have been working with throughout all this time as a PHP developer.

# Commands

`docker compose up -d`

Access php container:

`docker exec -ti php8-container bash`
